One of the main issues with this design is that users do not know where to start. There are lots of buttons and their labels do not make it easy to know what they do. For example, Micro express adds 30 seconds each time you press it but that is not obvious form the label. Another issue is the number of functions, as you can see from the GIF image, when you turn the dial it scrolls through a long list of different modes such as time cook, popcorn, vegetable-frozen, and so on. This is a poor design because it makes it, so you must press multiple buttons and scroll through several modes just to warm up food for a few minutes. Another problem with this design is the way you input your desired time. Instead of using buttons to input time, you use the dial to scroll up or down in 15 second intervals. This is a pain if you want to microwave or set a timer for a large amount of time, because you can only go up by 15 seconds each click of the dial.
